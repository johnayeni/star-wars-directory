# Star wars directory

A simple Vue js app which uses [SWAPI](https://swapi.co/) to provide a search directory for Star wars characters, ships and planets

## Project setup

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
npm run build
```

## Note

The images for the characters, planets and ships right now are just selected at random from some assests in [assets](https://github.com/johnayeni/star-wars-directory/tree/master/src/assets/img) folder. This is due to the fact that the [SWAPI](https://swapi.co/) does not return image links for any results and the images used are just for the User Interface period at this point.
